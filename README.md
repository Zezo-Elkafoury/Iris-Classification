# Iris Flower Classification

## Project Overview

The **Iris Flower Classification** project is an implementation of a machine learning model that classifies iris flowers into different species based on their physical characteristics. This project uses the Random Forest algorithm to predict the species of an iris flower based on its sepal and petal measurements.

## Features

- **Data Exploration**: Analyze the iris dataset to understand its structure and statistics.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Binarizes the target variable and splits the data into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes the Random Forest classifier to build a predictive model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assesses the accuracy of the model on the test dataset.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model building and evaluation.
